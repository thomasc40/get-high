	            	<p>A new review of "legal highs" could lead to sweeping changes to UK drug legislation, the Home Office has said.

Legal highs - officially known as psychoactive substances - are synthetic drugs which can be bought online and sometimes in shops.

The review follows concern drug laws are not flexible enough to tackle them.

Deaths from legal highs in England and Wales almost doubled to 52 last year. The government said it was "determined to clamp down on the reckless trade".

It is estimated that across the EU one new substance a week is being detected.
